Testing multiple outputs
========================

Introduction
------------

This is the step up from an XOR calculator - having a single output that is
mutated when "bad" is almost the same as training with "good" outputs.

This time we are making a simple network with 4 outputs and 2 inputs - a
simple robot. The order is (left, right) for the two bumpers and (left, right,
forward, reverse) for the robot directions. Left is clockwise from a birds-eye
view, the direction steers a castor so the robot has to be moving to turn.

"Good" is movement, "Bad" is no movement/stuck against something.

In action
---------

Firstly, we need a neural network to calculate the outputs

    >>> import neurolab
    >>> nn = neurolab.net.newff([[0, 1], [0, 1]],[5, 4])

And an adapter

    >>> import trainer
    >>> class AdaptNeurolabNN(trainer.LearningToolAdapter):
    ...
    ...     @property
    ...     def ci(self):
    ...         return self._lt.ci
    ...
    ...     @property
    ...     def co(self):
    ...         return self._lt.co
    ...
    ...     def learn(self, inputs, outputs):
    ...         self._lt.train(inputs, outputs, show=None, epochs=1000)
    ...
    ...     def process(self, input):
    ...         return self._lt.step(input)

    >>> ann = AdaptNeurolabNN(nn)

For the trainer we need to know which outputs are "state-sets" - ie, at most
one can be "on" at once - this stops invalid mutations happening, speeding up
the learning process. The numbers are output indexes covering a span. In this
instance they stop forward and reverse being on at the same time as well as
left and right being chosen at the same time. These may also be used to
prevent hardware damage - eg with the use of an H-Bridge for forward-back.

    >>> statesets = ((0, 1), (2, 3))
    >>> t = trainer.Trainer(ann, 10, statesets)

    >>> t._freeoutputs
    []

Firstly we need to be sure that it is not already pre-programmed - no bumpers
pressed should mean go forward (0, 0, 1, 0).

    >>> input = (0, 0)
    >>> _ = t.getoutput(input)

Now we train it, accepting when it is "good" - in this instance moving forward
at all when there's no bumpers being pressed.

    >>> while t.bad()[2] != 1:
    ...     pass

    >>> t.good()

If we hit a wall with the left bumper, forward right is ok, as is reversing to
the left.

    >>> input = (1, 0)
    >>> _ = t.getoutput(input)

    >>> while t.bad() not in ((0, 1, 1, 0), (1, 0, 0, 1)):
    ...     pass

    >>> t.good()

The opposite is the case with the right bumper

    >>> input = (0, 1)
    >>> _ = t.getoutput(input)

    >>> while t.bad() not in ((1, 0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 0, 1)):
    ...     pass

    >>> t.good()

And if we hit the wall with both bumpers we want reverse and possibly a
direction.

    >>> input = (1, 1)
    >>> _ = t.getoutput(input)

    >>> while t.bad()[3] != 1:
    ...     pass

    >>> t.good()

Now we can test it all at once

    >>> t.getoutput((0, 0)) == t._memory[0][1]
    True

    >>> t.getoutput((1, 0)) == t._memory[1][1]
    True

    >>> t.getoutput((0, 1)) == t._memory[2][1]
    True

    >>> t.getoutput((1, 1)) == t._memory[3][1]
    True
