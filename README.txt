Finally dev'ing a hunch - can you train a Neural Network using just "good" or
"bad" as feedback?

I say a Neural Network for now, but I will use whatever "brain" seems to work.

That said and done, this may just all "turn to custard" and I'll move onto
something else...

Goals to achieve in order to ensure that time isn't wasted if there is a
massive fundamental flaw :)

 1. XOR training replication - Done
 2. Multi-output training replication
